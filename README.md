# AI-Driven Job Recommendation and Skill Gap Analysis Platform

A full-stack AI-powered career support platform that helps users analyze their resume, identify skills, receive job recommendations, detect skill gaps from job descriptions, get personalized learning recommendations, and track career readiness progress.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **AI-Driven Job Recommendation and Skill Gap Analysis Platform** is designed to help students and job seekers understand their current skill level and improve their career preparation. Many users struggle to know which jobs match their skills, which skills they are missing, and what they should learn next. This system solves that problem by combining resume analysis, job recommendation, skill gap detection, and AI-based learning suggestions in one platform.

The system allows users to upload resumes, extract skills using AI, set career preferences, receive job recommendations, analyze job descriptions, identify missing skills, generate learning recommendations, and monitor their progress through a dashboard.
